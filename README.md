A classifier implemented to identify emotions from human speech using VAD scores aquired from a wave2vec model. This classifier is designed to work within ROS using a client and server relationship. The classifier demonstrated a 72.4% mean accuracy when tested against unseen RAVDESS files. It should be noted the classifier was trained on other RAVDESS audios so will exhibit bias.
